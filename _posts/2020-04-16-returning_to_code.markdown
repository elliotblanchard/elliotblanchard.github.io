I’m often asked why I decided to move from the arts into the world of code. The answer is interesting, and it shines a light on how code - and thinking like a dev - has become ever more intertwined with the arts.

I worked happily for many years in the world of design and animation. I entered the field after working briefly as a developer after college.  At that time, a wave of innovative software was replacing an older generation of specialized and expensive hardware. In spite of this, the day to day process of creating work was still incredibly labor intensive. Every second of animation required days - and in some cases weeks - of careful work. 

Over the years, that began to change. Technology began to transform not just the tools we used, but how we worked. We moved from thinking linearly to creating extensible visual systems. We thought less in terms of a passive audience, and became more interested in interaction and collaboration. QA and bugs entered our vocabulary. And static frameworks were replaced with flexible, node based systems. 

The software that we used continued to evolve. Visual programming languages, like Houdini’s VEX, enabled the creation of elaborate procedural geometry and effects. Real programming languages - like Python - became integral parts of the software and creative process. 

Code became part of our all of our lives. And it became comfortable - and familiar. The more I learned, the more I was interested. The more I became interested, the more I thought about getting back into tech. Like a lot of us, I started in small ways - a single course here and there, and small hobbyist projects. Those tentative steps made me realize that this was something I wanted to do seriously. A serious commitment required a comprehensive approach - and Flatiron offered it.
